                  As the race started the rabbit was very fast and tortise was very slow, then the tortise said to the rabbit shouting " Andi Mandi Shandi Jo bi 1st aaya Uski Amma *****".
                  Then the rabbit shitted in his pants, so he saw that it will take eternity for tortise co cross the finish line. Because of lack of patience Rabbit Surrendered and Tortise won without crossing the finish line and without being cursed by himself.</p>
